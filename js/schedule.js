	 "description": "Closed-source software is prevalent in our everyday lives, limiting our ability to understand how it works, which privacy implication it poses to the processed data, and addressing potential\
issues in time. Despite the growth of open-source movements, users often have no choice but to rely on closed-source solutions, e.g., for medical devices and IoT products. Reverse engineering\
provides a solution by partially reversing a program's compilation process, thereby making software open-source.\
\
In this talk, we'll explore the challenges of reverse engineering, specifically the difficulties of reverse engineering real-world products. Additionally, we'll discuss key techniques to help\
you get started with reverse engineering. Hacking your own devices can be challenging, bricking a device is not uncommon, but so is celebrating the moments of a revived and modified device.\

Why do we need development platforms and how can they democratize emerging fieleds and accelerate innovation? Why do most platform attempts fail and only very few succeed in terms of impact? I will discuss the key characteristics that any platform technology must have in order for it to be able to useful for diverse users, and will provide a framework I developed during my PhD for how to design and deploy platfom technologies. These high-level topics will be grounded in the contest of the FlowIO Platform and the opportunities, projects, and impact it has enabled until today.
